# EchoNet-Measurement -Automatic Annotation for Echocardiography-

## Repository Overview
This repository contains the deep learning model used for automatic annotation for 2D echo videos and Doppler images, along with the necessary code and weights to load the model and perform inference on your echo videos. Users can easily run predictions using the provided codes and weights.

**Project Overview**   
This project focuses on building a deep-learning model that can automatically annotate specific measurements from echocardiographic videos or images. Annotation of measurements on images is typically a time-consuming task for cardiologists and sonographer, especially with the growing volume of echocardiographic exams being performed. Automating this process has the potential to significantly improve efficiency in clinical workflows, and potentially reduce human-error, and allow high-throughput cardiovascular research using echocardiography. Our model aims to streamline this annotation process and guide parameter measurements with faster and more accurate manner.

Herein, we show gif file. Please refer `videos/EchoNet_Annotation.mp4` if you want see video file.

- **Presentation**: Conference information will be updated.  
- **Preprint**: link will be added once preprint is released  
- **Paper**: link will be added once preprint is released

**Key Benefits in the clinical practice**:
- Efficiency: Reducing the time needed for manual annotations.
- Scalability: Addressing the increasing number of echo exams by automating routine tasks.
- Accuracy: Providing consistent and reliable annotations of echocardiography parameters.


## Model Information:
**Segmentation Model**

- Backbone: deeplabv3_resnet50 (num_classes=1 or 2, depend on the task) 
- 2D Video Model: For 2D echocardiographic videos, our model is trained and operates on videos with a resolution of 480 and 640.
- Doppler Image Model: For Doppler images, our model is designed to process videos at a resolution of 426×1080.

    - **Why 426×1080?**
    Typically, DICOM images are stored with a resolution of 768×1024 (but I think it can depend on the vendor and hospital). However, the area where Doppler information is displayed usually starts around pixel 342-344 in the vertical axis (if original is stored 768*1024). Thus, we calculate the height for the Doppler image as 426 (by subtracting 342 from 768). This ensures that the model focuses only on the relevant Doppler information, optimizing both computational resources and model performance.
    Inside the code (`inference_Doppler_image.py`), we automatically selected suitable region for Doppler assessment.


## Contents
1. model/: Contains the trained deep learning model weights for echo video annotation.
2. inference_XXX.py: Script for loading the model and running inference on input echo videos or Dicoms.
3. utils/: Contains the code for getting doppler region from dicom and hosrizontal line for Doppler image etc.


## How to Use:
**1. Clone the repository**:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/echonet/measurements.git
cd your-repository-name
```

**2. Install dependencies**:

Note: we use python 3.9 or 3.10 for training/inference.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This repository uses Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) to manage large files (model weights). 
A simple git clone will only download placeholder files (around 4KB each) instead of the actual ckpt large files.

```sh
(sudo) apt update
(sudo) apt install git-lfs
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

**3. Run inference**:  
- **3-1 and 3-3. Linear Measurement** (like IVS, LAD, AORTA)  

for model_weights, please refer to --model_weights choices in the script.
Either AVI, MP4, or DICOM format works for input.

If you want to make frame-to-frame prediction, you should enter **Dicom images**.
```sh
python inference_2D_image.py --model_weights VARIABLE_LIKE_IVS --file_path "YOUR_ECHO_AVI_OR_DICOM_FILEPATH (480 and 640 resolution)"  --output_path "YOUR_OUTPUT_PATH.mp4"
```

- **3-2. Doppler Annotation Prediction**  

for model_weights, please refer to --model_weights choices in the script.
Input should be DICOM image since specific DICOM Tag information is needed.
```sh
python inference_Doppler_image.py --model_weights "VARIABLE_LIKE_TRVMAX"  --file_path "YOUR_DICOM.dcm" --output_path "YOUR_OUTPUT_PATH.jpg"
```

- `inference_XXXXX_folders.py` process a folder of DICOM files for inference. These outputs annotated images and saves predicted_measurement and metadatato a CSV file.
For examples, `inference_Doppler_image.py` process one Dicom images, but `inference_Doppler_image_folders.py` processes multiple files and create csv files.

- **3-4. Phase Estimation**  

using `get_systole_diastole` funstion in utils.py, you can estimate max diameter timeframe and minimun diameter timeframe

**Important Notes on Demo Videos**
Demo videos that illustrate how the model works in real-world applications. At this time, demo App are not publicly released because the Dicom data typically contains personal information and Gradio does not fully comply with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) standards. 
To protect patient privacy and sensitive information, we have decided not to make the demo videos publicly available. Herein, we used **de-identified Dicom files** for this demo.
